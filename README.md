Bankist App - DOM Manipulation Exercise


Overview
This project is part of Jonas Schmedtmann's "The Complete JavaScript Course" on Udemy. It's a fictional online banking interface called Bankist, designed to practice advanced DOM manipulation techniques with vanilla JavaScript.

Personal Notes
While this isn't my original project, building it helped me:

Understand complex DOM interactions

Improve my problem-solving approach

Learn modern JavaScript patterns

Gain confidence in vanilla JS development

I've added my own code comments and experimented with some modifications beyond the course materials to deepen my understanding.
